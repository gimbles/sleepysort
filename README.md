# Sleepysort! 
A dumb sorting algorithm implemented in Rust.

# How does it work?
It loops over all the integers in a list and spawns a thread for each iteration, in the thread it puts the thread to sleep for n*10 ms and then prints n out.

# How to use it?
`cargo run <Your numberydoos mate>`
Example - `cargo run 420 69 42 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1`
